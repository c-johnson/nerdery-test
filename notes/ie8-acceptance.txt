Here are the remaining deviations with IE8:
  - linear-gradient not supported in IE8
    - Navigation bar shadings
  - :before + z-index doesn't work
    - Carousel blue border
    - "play" button for videos
  - CSS triangles strange behavior on "browse category" headers
  - Placeholders don't work in IE8 without additional support
