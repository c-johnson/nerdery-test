DONE:
  - Carousel functionality, active styling, etc.
    - Make this extensible (up to 4 images).
    - The carousel should auto-rotate on page load and stop rotating when the user interacts with it, continuing its rotation once the user is no longer in the hit area of the carousel.
    - Additional slide captions are embedded in PSD
  - Double-check code (stylesheets, javascripts, etc).  Clean everything up.
    - Check semanticness of elements, see where I can improve
    - Run through HTML, JS, CSS validator
    - Double-check pixel-perfectness
  - Test thoroughly in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome
  - Test thoroughly in IE8
  - Accessibility...everywhere
    - Alt text for images
    - Tab focus stuff
    - Aria roles?!
  - Make tabs work

TODO (Friday):
  
  - Browse Categories collapse/expand functionality
  - Form element -- make sure is marked up appropriately.
  - Watch Nerdery code standards video for any more clues
  - Update total scope with estimates, time it took for each section, etc.
